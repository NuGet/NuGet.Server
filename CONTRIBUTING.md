# Contributing

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions. Most contributions require you to agree to the [.NET Foundation Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://cla.dotnetfoundation.org) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., label, comment). Simply follow the instructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all projects in the .NET Foundation.

This project has adopted the code of conduct defined by the Contributor Covenant to clarify expected behavior in our community. For more information, see the [.NET Foundation Code of Conduct](https://dotnetfoundation.org/code-of-conduct).
